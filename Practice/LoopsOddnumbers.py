# Basic problem gaining all the odd numbers in a set range
# Utlisation of for loops and modulus

# Use a for loop to cycle through from 1 to 21

for i in range (21):

# Use modulus to check that the result is not equal to zero

    if i % 2 != 0:

# print all the odd numbers in the range...

        print ("i=", i)
